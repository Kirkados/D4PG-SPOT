# D4PG-SPOT
A D4PG implementation of a debris capture task presented at Carleton University's Spacecraft Proximity Operations Testbed.

To plot and animate some experimental data, run experiment_analyze.pi (from Spyder). It will plot the data generated by use_deep_guidance_spot.py

To simulate what would have happened given identical initial conditions to the lab, modify settings.py to use ICs as the environment, set resume_trainig to True, and reduce the number of actors to 1. Run main.py from Ubuntu tf1.0 and the next video rendered will be the expected behaviour.

The two animations can then be compared
